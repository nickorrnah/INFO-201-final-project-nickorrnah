## Domain of Interest: Twitch

We have selected the online streaming platform, Twitch, as our domain of interest.

Our interest stems from the vast amount of growth that has occurred in online streaming in recent years.  During the pandemic, Twitch seemingly grew from just a niche entertainment platform, to almost a household name.  However, that is only based on our observations.  With this project, we would like to take a closer examination at those observations.  Additionally, Nick has been a long time viewer of Twitch, and has also streamed a bit in the past.

Twitch gives public access to many of its statistics through its public API. This has lead to many fantastic data projects that have been done by the Twitch community.  One of the most interesting of these is the Twitch Atlas, which provides an interactive atlas that highlights viewership overlap between streamers. Streams Charts is another data project that gathers real-time statistics and displays them with interactive and customizable graphs. A third data project created from Twitch data is Twitch Insights.  This project mainly focuses on gathering and displaying data and stats relating to game popularity on Twitch.

Our 3 data-driven questions that we hope to answer are:

- How much has Twitch's user base grown after the pandemic?

- How has Twitch's usage changed in the last years?

- What is the correlation between hours streamed and hours watched?
